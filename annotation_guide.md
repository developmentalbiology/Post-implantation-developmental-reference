# üß¨ Single-Cell Cell Type Annotations for Human and Macaca fascicularis Embryos

> **Purpose**: This document provides a comprehensive annotation guide for the `reanno` cell types in human and macaque embryonic single-cell datasets, including their developmental stage distributions. It is intended to help researchers unfamiliar with these datasets understand the biological context of each annotated cell population.

## 1. Human Embryo Cell Type Annotations

The annotations provided here are based on an integration of six published single-cell transcriptomic datasets, covering human embryonic development from embryonic day (E) 6 to approximately post-conception week 3 (PCW3, E22, Carnegie stage (CS) 10). The integrated dataset was systematically reannotated using a multi-tiered approach. We defined 12 major developmental lineage labels (stored as 'lineage') and a more granular set of 49 cell type labels (stored as 'reanno'). Original cell type and subtype annotations from the source studies were stored as 'orig_anno' and 'orig_sub_anno', respectively. A preliminary harmonized annotation (harmo.anno) was created by classifying the original annotations before integration. The details of the final lineage and reanno labels in our reannotation system are explained in bellow.

## 2. Macaca fascicularis Embryo Cell Type Annotations

The annotations provided here integrated seven published single-cell transcriptomic datasets covering cynomolgus monkey development from embryonic day (E) 6 to Carnegie stage (CS) 11 (approximately E24). A total of 55 cell type annotations were integrated from the original cell type and subtype annotations reported in multiple previously published studies, and are represented as `"reanno"` in the single-cell dataset. For reference to the original annotations from individual studies, please refer to the columns `"orig_anno"` and `"orig_sub_anno"` in the single-cell data. The dataset encompasses 28 distinct developmental stages across in vivo and in vitro conditions.
